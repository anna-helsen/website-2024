            Exploring a space somewhere between dreams and reality, users could playfully explore movement as interaction with a techno-natural lifeform in a surreal setting.
        </p>

        <p class="PROJdescription">
            The installation Between Dreams and Reality shows the hybrid
            world of humanity and machines. It plays with interpretation of
            the real and surreal, conscious and subconscious, dystopias and
            utopias.
        <br><br>
            At the centre of the installation is the Dream Machine. Referencing
            the interplay between conscious and sub- or unconsciousness,
            similar to the Dream Machine from the Beatnik movement in the
            1960s, this 2024 version highlights the interplay between people
            and their surroundings.
        <br><br>
            Viewers can strike different poses, which are detected via a
            RaspberryPi camera (using the Python library “MediaPipe” and
            “OpenCV”). The rotating 3D coral at the centre of the Dream
            Machine is influenced by the pose of the viewer. The more room
            they occupy and the larger they make themselves, the more arms
            of the coral will wither. The connection between the pose detection
            and the trigger of the various coral animations, created and rigged
            in Blender by me, are brought together in the open source game
            engine Godot, which was implemented by Kai-Uwe Hermann.
        <br><br>
            The concept of the scenographic surrounding focuses on creating
            a dream-like environment and a mindful use of resources, created
            together with the artist Desirée Eppele, who also created the mural-
            like painting on the wall of the room and the chrome branches
            hanging off the ceiling and creating a techno-natural reference to
            the site’s history of the Hoepfner Stiftung - a pub called The Green
            Tree.
        <br><br>
            The materials used in this installation are natural materials where
            possible otherwise were sourced second hand, out of disposal
            sites or repurposed. The large fabric banners creating the cave-like
            appearance are nettle fabric which we dyed using traditional dyeing
            methods and natural dyes such as madder root, mallow flowers,
            beetroot, cabbage and turmeric.
        <br><br>
            Soundtracks created for the installation were cast using exciter
            speakers and can be found on the Soundcloud website here: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/between-dreams-reality/sets/between-dreams-and-reality">SOUNDCLOUD</a>
